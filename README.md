What i learnt: it was a great opportunity to try and apply what i have learnt from udemy!

1. working with input range and how to customise their styling:

2. every sibling item needs a key prop to help react identify what items changed
3. for useEffect, only variables outside of the useEffect scope & within the component function need to be added as a dependency
